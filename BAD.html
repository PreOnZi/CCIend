    <p>No, I did not forget about styling this page, it is meant to look like this. It's what one gets for not liking what I say.</p>

    <p>Now, I know this whole thing is a gimmick. It's not all that pretty, I used a lot of help, even though it is so basic and so on.<bR> But I did not want to leave the year without saying anything. In a way that I had time to think about it more. Not when running out of the festival. <br>And I am truly grateful.</p>
