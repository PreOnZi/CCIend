I appreciate your help with my projects, I admire that you remember us (so many faces, names...?!) and somewhat manage to seem happy when you see us? Your support and attitude towards what you teach make such a difference in how I - and I am sure others - feel about the (or any) subject. I tend to get overwhelmed by people like this if I am being honest. Because I like staying to the side. But your enthusiasm is so genuine and informed, that I was left admiring and appreciating everything you did. Now, when it came to the festival, although we did not work together that much, you reassured me. Overall, Agnes, I truly appreciate what you do and HOW you do it. I came to university after a 3-year gap, hoping to become somewhat younger again, while learning. However, from my experience at LCC, I mostly feel frustrated with the lack of communication and organisation and unsatisfied with everything we are taught - from the approach of the lecturers to the materials themselves. The whole advertising course feels quite hollow. It hit me that much harder then, when I was returning my components and you smiled when seeing me, because I realised I was leaving all this, to go back to the dull and empty - and 'enthusiasless' - course. I appreciate this may come across as a bit dramatic, but I don't get excited too easily, I like laying low and something about the undemanding and slow nature of my home course suits me - I can work more in a job I hate. But now that I have experienced what university can feel like, I am indeed going to miss it very much. Thank you, Agnes." ,
