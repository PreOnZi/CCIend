                  "Jen, I liked your lessons straight away and I really loved your approach to them. The structure, where I could either work further or leave at the end? I instantly missed it in every other class. The level of organisation and prepared materials. I admired it from the very beginning and connected to it as well. Then there was the actual subject you taught us. Establishing the connection between something on the screen with something physical was so revolutionary to me that I instantly fell in love with the first LED I managed to turn on and, therefore, I fell in love with physical computing. Now, there is your teaching style. Something I would probably aspire to if I wanted to get into education (but I don't have your patience and skills, so I do not). I admire how calm, collected and knowledgeable you are. Every problem gets methodical attention. You are a very kind and calm presence in the class. I am 'slightly' repeating myself when it comes to this; as I 'talk' to each one of you, I talk about what I expected of university, how disappointed I was and how the year at CCI was different. Tuesday's classes were a stark opposite (and much appreciated) of what disappointed me so much at LCC. The organisation - we started on time. The content - fulfilling. And an enthusiastic person at the front. I did not get to try your shield because I missed the very first Monday class and it took me way too long to settle enough to have the bandwidth to accept more. I hope it went well and you got what you needed from the trial. You had an irreplaceable part in making my time at CCI so valuable and pleasant (although packed and often stressful). And I am very grateful for that. I will try to find a way of getting the distance and scaling down even outside computing projects. Thank you, Jen, I will miss Tuesday's classes very much." ,
